Hello Golang
============

Material presented at [jenadevs meetup](https://www.meetup.com/jenadevs/) 008, June 8, 2017 18:00 CEST at Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena.

There are some introductory [slides](https://github.com/miku/hellogolang/blob/master/Slides.pdf) (built from [Markdown](https://github.com/miku/hellogolang/blob/master/Slides.md) with [Marp](https://yhatt.github.io/marp/)). The hands-on part consisted of a few example programs, which are located under [examples](https://github.com/miku/hellogolang/tree/master/examples).

Each example can be executed with a simple call, e.g.:

```
$ go run examples/hello.go
Hello 세계, 1, 15
```
